### Design Rationale

#### Layout

The layout follows a clear hierarchy with a consistent navigation structure. Content is grouped logically and using a table for ease of scanning and interaction.

#### Color Scheme

A minimal and high-contrast color palette was chosen to reduce visual clutter and enhance readability, using a lot of white space. Accent colors are used sparingly to draw attention to calls to action - intuitively allowing the user to know the submit button vs delete vs cancel.

#### Typography

Sans-serif fonts were selected for a modern and clean appearance. A consistent font scale ensures readability across devices, with distinct weights used to establish hierarchy.

#### Accessibility

- Colors meet WCAG AA contrast requirements.
- Semantic HTML elements are used for screen reader compatibility.
- ARIA labels are included where necessary.

## Agile Methodology

This project was developed following **Agile principles**, focusing on iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability to change.  

Key Agile practices applied include:  

- **Incremental Delivery** â€“ Features were developed and delivered in small, manageable increments.  
- **Frequent Testing** â€“ Manual and responsive testing were performed throughout the development cycle to ensure quality.  
- **Continuous Feedback** â€“ Regular reviews and feedback loops were used to refine features and improve user experience.  


## Deployment

The Talkr Portal is deployed using Heroku. Continuous deployment is enabled through GitHub integration. The app is accessible at:

ðŸ”— [https://talkrportal-6cf86883a4fe.herokuapp.com/portal/](https://talkrportal-6cf86883a4fe.herokuapp.com/portal/)


**Deployment Overview:**

- The project is configured for production using **Gunicorn** as the web server and **Whitenoise** for static file handling.
- A `Procfile` and `requirements.txt` are included, and production settings are applied in `settings.py`.
- The app is version-controlled with Git and pushed to Heroku for deployment.
- Environment variables such as `SECRET_KEY` and database configuration are set on Heroku.
- Database migrations are run and static files are collected automatically during deployment.

Once deployed, the application is accessible via the Heroku URL provided.

## AI Implementation and Orchestration

AI was used throughout the build of this portal - utilising co-pilot for help with the code. ChatGpt for help with the user stories and README.

Key areas include:

### 1. Code Generation
AI was used to assist in generating boilerplate code, implementing complex functions, and suggesting best practices. This helped accelerate development and reduce manual effort while maintaining code quality.

### 2. Bug Identification & Resolution
AI contributed to debugging by analysing error messages, suggesting potential fixes, and identifying edge cases. This facilitated faster resolution of issues and improved overall stability.

### 3. Performance & UX Improvements
AI insights guided optimisations in both backend performance and user experience. Recommendations included refactoring inefficient code, optimising database queries, and improving response times, leading to a smoother, more responsive application.

### 4. Workflow Influence
AI shaped the development workflow by offering structured guidance, suggesting testing approaches, and providing code review-like feedback. This allowed for more efficient iteration and better prioritisation of tasks.
