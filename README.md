### Design Rationale

#### Layout

The layout follows a clear hierarchy with a consistent navigation structure. Content is grouped logically and using a table for ease of scanning and interaction.

#### Color Scheme

A minimal and high-contrast color palette was chosen to reduce visual clutter and enhance readability, using a lot of white space. Accent colors are used sparingly to draw attention to calls to action - intuitively allowing the user to know the submit button vs delete vs cancel.

#### Typography

Sans-serif fonts were selected for a modern and clean appearance. A consistent font scale ensures readability across devices, with distinct weights used to establish hierarchy.

#### Accessibility

- All interactive elements have a minimum target size of 44x44px.
- Colors meet WCAG AA contrast requirements.
- Semantic HTML elements are used for screen reader compatibility.
- ARIA labels are included where necessary.
